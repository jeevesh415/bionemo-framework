# Overview of BioNeMo

BioNeMo is a software ecosystem produced by NVIDIA for the development and deployment of life sciences-oriented artificial intelligence models. The main components of BioNeMo are:

## [BioNeMo Recipes](../recipes/index.md)

BioNeMo Recipes are self-contained, reproducible training recipes for biomolecular and language models. Each recipe bundles a HuggingFace-compatible model definition, training scripts, configuration, and sample data into a single directory that can be run independently. Recipes are composed of

### Models

HuggingFace-compatible model definitions with TransformerEngine layers:

- [AMPLIFY](../recipes/models/amplify/index.md) -- protein representation learning
- [ESM-2](../recipes/models/esm2/index.md) -- protein representation learning
- [Geneformer](../recipes/models/geneformer/index.md) -- single-cell gene expression
- [Llama 3](../recipes/models/llama3/index.md) -- general-purpose language model
- [Mixtral](../recipes/models/mixtral/index.md) -- mixture-of-experts language model
- [Qwen](../recipes/models/qwen/index.md) -- general-purpose language model

### Training Recipes

Complete training environments with scripts, configs, and sample data:

- [esm2_native_te](../recipes/recipes/esm2_native_te/index.md) -- ESM-2 pretraining with native FSDP + TransformerEngine
- [esm2_accelerate_te](../recipes/recipes/esm2_accelerate_te/index.md) -- ESM-2 pretraining with HF Accelerate + TransformerEngine
- [esm2_peft_te](../recipes/recipes/esm2_peft_te/index.md) -- ESM-2 parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- [geneformer_native_te_mfsdp_fp8](../recipes/recipes/geneformer_native_te_mfsdp_fp8/index.md) -- Geneformer pretraining with FP8
- [llama3_native_te](../recipes/recipes/llama3_native_te/index.md) -- Llama 3 pretraining with native FSDP
- [fp8_analysis](../recipes/recipes/fp8_analysis/index.md) -- FP8 precision analysis tools
- [vit](../recipes/recipes/vit/index.md) -- Vision Transformer reference recipe

#### Megatron recipes

Megatron training recipes are for models that benefit from larger scale 5D parallelism, or users who would like examples of training with the megatron framework.

- [evo2_megatron](../recipes/recipes/evo2_megatron/index.md) -- Evo2 DNA model with Megatron-Bridge based training for 5D parallelism support
- [eden_megatron](../recipes/recipes/eden_megatron/index.md) -- Eden DNA model with Megatron-Bridge based training for 5D parallelism support

## [BioNeMo Sub-packages](../developer-guide/SUMMARY.md)

Lightweight, pip-installable Python packages that provide reusable building blocks for training and data processing:

- [bionemo-core](../developer-guide/bionemo-core/bionemo-core-Overview.md) -- shared interfaces, data-loading helpers, and checkpoint management
- [bionemo-moco](../developer-guide/bionemo-moco/bionemo-moco-Overview.md) -- modular components for building diffusion and flow-matching generative models
- [bionemo-noodles](../developer-guide/bionemo-noodles/bionemo-noodles-Overview.md) -- fast FASTA/FASTQ parsing via a Python wrapper around the Rust [noodles](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles) library
- [bionemo-scdl](../developer-guide/bionemo-scdl/bionemo-scdl-Overview.md) -- dataset classes optimized for single-cell data
- [bionemo-size-aware-batching](../developer-guide/bionemo-size-aware-batching/bionemo-size-aware-batching-Overview.md) -- memory-aware mini-batch construction for variable-length inputs
- [bionemo-webdatamodule](../developer-guide/bionemo-webdatamodule/bionemo-webdatamodule-Overview.md) -- a PyTorch Lightning DataModule for streaming WebDataset files

## [BioNeMo NIMs](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/biology)

BioNeMo NIMs are easy-to-use, enterprise-ready _inference_ microservices with built-in API endpoints. NIMs are engineered for scalable, self- or cloud-hosted deployment of optimized, production-grade biomolecular foundation models.

Use the **recipes** and **sub-packages** when you need to train, fine-tune, or customize models. Use **NIMs** when you need production-ready inference against existing models.
