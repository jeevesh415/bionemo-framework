# Development with BioNeMo

This page covers the current development model for the repository.

## Code overview

BioNeMo Framework now has two main development workflows:

- **Recipe development** in `bionemo-recipes/`, where model implementations and end-to-end training or inference workflows live.
- **Framework library development** in `sub-packages/`, where reusable utilities and biology-oriented workflow libraries live.

### Recipe isolation

Each recipe should be treated as if it were its own isolated repository. Recipes may `pip install` packages from the
`sub-packages/` framework libraries or from external sources, but they must not assume those packages are already
available in the environment. Every recipe is responsible for declaring how its dependencies are installed (e.g. in a
`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `Dockerfile`). This ensures recipes remain portable and self-contained — a
user should be able to clone the repository, enter a recipe directory, and follow its instructions to get a working
environment without relying on any implicit global state.

Examples of current framework libraries include:

- `bionemo-core`: shared interfaces and data utilities
- `bionemo-recipeutils`: shared utilities used by multiple recipes
- `bionemo-scdl`: single-cell dataset loading and conversion
- `bionemo-moco`: molecular co-design utilities
- `bionemo-webdatamodule`: `WebDataset` helpers

## Package structure

Most framework packages follow the same structure:

- `pyproject.toml`: package metadata and dependencies
- `src/`: importable source code
- `tests/`: package tests
- `examples/` or `notebooks/`: optional tutorial material that is pulled into the docs build
- `README.md`: package overview and usage notes

## Training and fine-tuning

Training entrypoints for supported models live in `bionemo-recipes`.

See also [Training Models](./training-models.md).

Common locations:

- `bionemo-recipes/models/esm2`
- `bionemo-recipes/models/amplify`
- `bionemo-recipes/models/geneformer`
- `bionemo-recipes/recipes/evo2_megatron`
- `bionemo-recipes/recipes/esm2_native_te`
- `bionemo-recipes/recipes/esm2_accelerate_te`
- `bionemo-recipes/recipes/geneformer_native_te_mfsdp_fp8`

When a recipe or local workflow depends on a framework package, install that package into your active environment with an editable install:

```bash
uv pip install -e ./sub-packages/bionemo-core
uv pip install -e ./sub-packages/bionemo-scdl
uv pip install -e "./sub-packages/bionemo-recipeutils[basecamp]"
```

## Data and checkpoints

The `download_bionemo_data` CLI remains the standard way to fetch supported BioNeMo datasets and checkpoints:

```bash
download_bionemo_data --list-resources
```

Set `DATA_SOURCE=ngc` for public resources, or `DATA_SOURCE=pbss` for internal NVIDIA workflows where applicable.
